# code-quiz
This is a dynamic quiz using html, css, and javascript with 4 timed questions that will deduct time when a question is answered incorrectly.  Upon the timer reaching 0 or the last question being answered, the user will be prompted to enter their name for the highscores.  After entering their name and clicking the submit button, the user will be brought to the high scores page, where they can view the scores and clear the scores, and can go back and play again.
Some Bootstrap and jQuery were used.
