# Quiz

## Description
This is a front end dynamic quiz has 11 timed questions displayed one at a time with four possible answers for the player to select.  If a question is answered incorrectly, 10 seconds are automatically deducted, and if correct, will move on to the next question.  Upon the timer reaching 0 or the last question being answered, the user will be prompted to enter their name for the highscores page.  After entering their name and clicking the submit button, the user will be brought to the high scores page, where they can view the scores, clear the scores, and can go back and play again.  Scores are saved in localStorage.
